<h1 id="toc_0">I Am Bad At Emails</h1>

<p>I am become Sisyphus, and the inbox is my boulder.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t give each email a thoughtful response, but I&#39;d feel dirty giving a <em>thoughtless</em> response. So, I wrote this FAQ to give you thoughtful answers <em>now</em>, rather than have you wait 4+ weeks for a useless reply. Check it out!</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">I&#39;ve sent you a fan letter!</h3>

<p>Awww 💖 Thank you!  I sincerely mean that.  I most likely won&#39;t be able to reply (I Am Bad At Emails) but I promise you I read each fan letter, and put them in a folder labelled &quot;awww&quot;, so I can re-read them whenever I&#39;m feeling down:</p>

<p>[I Am Bad At Emails]()</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">May I reuse/remix your work?</h3>

<p>Sure! All my work is public domain under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero waiver</a>. That means you can reuse/remix it for the classroom, your blog, a YouTube video, any purpose at all.  Attribution is kind to both me &amp; your audience, but not legally mandatory.</p>

<p>Why do I do this? Partly my belief that copyright law has ditched &quot;foster creativity&quot; as a goal and is now just crony rent-seeking. Partly because I want educators &amp; bloggers to reuse my work without fear of legal goons. And partly because life is too short to send legal goons.</p>

<p>You can get the code/art to all my projects <a href="https://github.com/ncase">on Github</a>!</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">May I translate your work?</h3>

<p>Thank you, and yes! Note that most of my projects already have fan-translations – if you go to the project page, you&#39;ll find a list of translations in a sidebar or at the bottom. If your language isn&#39;t there, the list will also link to instructions on how to translate it!</p>

<p>(Because I Am Bad At Emails, it&#39;ll take me a few weeks to link to your translation online. Sorry!)</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">I noticed your work on platform X – was that allowed?</h3>

<p>Legally yes, since all my stuff is public domain (see [above answer]).</p>

<p>However, if the uploader is <em>pretending to be me,</em> that&#39;s probably against the platform&#39;s impersonation rules! So, to be clear:</p>

<p><strong>I HAVE NEVER PUBLISHED ANYTHING ON THE APP STORE, OR ON STEAM.</strong></p>

<p>Full list of where I <em>do</em> publish stuff: <a href="https://ncase.me/">my website</a>, <a href="https://ncase.itch.io/">itch.io</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/ncase">Vimeo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_zZ8QA-J3r-UiATQImmWg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://nutcasenightmare.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>. (But my ancient Flash games are all over the place: Kongregate, ArmorGames, and others I&#39;m forgetting)</p>

<p>If my stuff is somewhere I didn&#39;t post it, but 1) it&#39;s labelled &quot;[Fan Port]&quot; or &quot;[Unofficial]&quot;, or 2) credits me in a way that&#39;s clear they&#39;re <em>not</em> me, and 3) has a link to the free original, then: that&#39;s A-OK!  If not, kindly (KINDLY) let the poster know to do that.  Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">May I commission you / interview you / invite you to do a talk?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m currently on hiatus, so sadly no!  I&#39;m very flattered though.  But if you&#39;d like another maker of Explorable Explanations to work with, check out the other creators at <a href="https://explorabl.es/">Explorabl.es</a>!</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">I have a suggestion / fix / idea for a project!</h3>

<p>If it&#39;s a small glitch or typo, thank you so much for catching it! I&#39;ll fix it as soon as I can – (that is: a few weeks, coz I Am Bad At Emails) – and I could add you to the credits if you&#39;d like!</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a bigger suggestion (like adding another voting method to <em>Build A Better Ballot</em> or more strategies to <em>Evolution of Trust</em>) sadly I must decline, otherwise I&#39;d do nothing but update all my old works forever. I must leave them as they are, with all their flaws.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Could you help me with a project?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m flattered, but sadly I don&#39;t have the capacity to collaborate directly, or give specific tailored feedback. But if all you need is to reuse/remix my work, you already have my permission, <a href="#toc_2">see above answer!</a> As for general advice on how to write/code/design/learn, <a href="#toc_9">see the answers below!</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_8">For some reason I need biographical information about you</h3>

<p>Name: Nicky Case</p>

<p>DOB: September 11th, 1994</p>

<p>Sex: Infrequent</p>

<p>Pronouns: I&#39;m <em>personally</em> ok with any pronoun, but if you need to pick one for a blog post or Wiki article, they/them works!</p>

<p>Citizenship: Canada (born in Singapore)</p>

<p>Where In Canada: Somewhere In Canada</p>

<p>Ethnicity: Chinese-Malaysian mutt, or, “Asian”.</p>

<p>Education: College dropout</p>

<p>Astrological Sign: No. Make your <em>own</em> destiny.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">How Do I Learn...</h3>

<p>First, some general advice:</p>

<p>Most people (including myself!) practice inefficiently by default. Or if they <em>do</em> practice &quot;efficiently&quot;, it&#39;s at the cost of being boring &amp; demotivating.</p>

<p>So, to learn in a way that&#39;s efficient <em>and</em> motivating, I recommend <strong>making <em>small</em> projects.</strong> If you just learned about Special Relativity, write a <em>short</em> essay explaining it in lay words. If you want to practice writing dialogue, write a <em>short</em> story with lots of talking.</p>

<p>Also, I highly recommend <strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>. It&#39;s &quot;flashcards on steroids&quot;, backed by replicated cognitive science. Check out <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/">this video</a>. Most people use the app <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, but I use a physical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvF1XuseZFE">Leitner Box</a>, coz the tactility makes it more fun, thus more motivating. Note: Spaced Repetition isn&#39;t just for memorizing raw facts, but also deeper understanding – to your cards, add &quot;why&quot; questions, visual proofs, practice problems, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, read this: <strong><a href="http://presentationcollege.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-works-what-doesnt.pdf">What Works, What Doesn&#39;t</a></strong>. It&#39;s a summary by 5 cognitive scientists on what studying methods work or don&#39;t. (For example: highlighting &amp; re-reading, the two most popular methods, don&#39;t work.)</p>

<p>Now, for learning <em>specific</em> things...</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Math</h3>

<p><em>The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, “math class is stupid and boring,” and they are right.</em><br>
~ <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A Mathematician&#39;s Lament</a></p>

<p>If I were the Education Czar, I would remove math from the compulsory curriculum, <em>because</em> I love math. Nothing kills the love for something like <em>forcing people to do it with no intrinsic motivation.</em></p>

<p>So if you wanna learn a math topic, please first <em>know your motivation</em>. Maybe there&#39;s a real-world use (Bayes&#39; Theorem, nonlinear dynamics), or beautiful for its own sake (geometry, complex analysis). Whatever it is, <strong>Step 1: know your purpose.</strong></p>

<p>Then <strong>Step 2: intuition first.</strong> Imagine a music class where students draw notes on bars for years <em>and never hear an actual song</em>. That&#39;s math class. If you&#39;re learning math topic X, first look up &quot;[X] visual&quot; or &quot;[X] intuition&quot; on YouTube or DuckDuckGo/Google. (My fave math resources are listed below)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: practice with feedback.</strong> Use spaced repetition (<a href="#toc_9">see above</a>) to practice recalling facts, deep conceptual questions, and even quick practice problems. Yes, this is the boring step, but if you know your purpose &amp; have the intuition, it&#39;ll feel and <em>be</em> meaningful.</p>

<p>My fave math resources:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393337174">The Art of Strategy</a> for game theory. (P.S: I read this book 15 years ago for fun, <em>then</em> my Econ professor assigned it as a textbook. <code>hackerman.jpeg</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses">The Theoretical Minimum</a> for physics. (books &amp; free Stanford lectures online)</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven&#39;t personally used these resources much, but I&#39;ve heard great things about them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a> (STEM, fundamentals &amp; advanced)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (the whole K-12 curriculum)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_11">Writing</h3>

<p>To make your writing flow: <a href="https://vimeo.com/123759973">Therefore &amp; But, Not &quot;And Then&quot;</a>. Novices write &quot;this happens <em>and then</em> that happens <em>and then</em> this happens&quot;... <em>but</em> that&#39;s boring... <em>therefore</em> you should connect things like: &quot;this happens <em>but</em> that happens <em>therefore</em> this happens.&quot;</p>

<p><em>(and then...)</em></p>

<p>To make your writing concise: write your first draft, get its word count, then multiply that number by 0.9 (90%). <em>Cut your writing down to that new word count.</em> (I got this tip from <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060891541">On Writing Well</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780205309023">Strunk &amp; White</a> is actually helpful?)</p>

<p>Finally, don&#39;t worry about writing with &quot;style&quot;. Just write with <em>substance</em>. What you find substantial is what you find valuable. Your set of values is what makes your voice identifiable. Your voice is your style.</p>

<p>Therefore: substance <em>creates</em> style.
Cook something nutritious <em>and</em> delicious.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Writing accessible explanations</h3>

<p>In my answer on <a href="#toc_10">how to learn math</a>, I listed the steps: <strong>1) Purpose, 2) Intuition, <em>then</em> 3) Practice.</strong> How to <em>teach</em> math, or any topic, is just giving your learner those three things in that order.</p>

<p>Specific tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> <a href="https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/if-math-is-the-aspirin-then-how-do-you-create-the-headache/">First give them the headache, then give them the aspirin.</a> And if possible, show cool visuals &amp; real-world uses.</li>
<li><strong>Intuition:</strong> <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/my-favourite-pedagogical-principle-examples-first/">EXAMPLES FIRST</a>. Use the <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/">ADEPT Method</a>. Show pictures. When possible, give intuitive proofs for facts, not just &quot;hey memorize this crap&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Problems:</strong> Cognitive apprenticeship – first do a &quot;worked example&quot; where you show your process, <em>then</em> give the learner a similar problem to tackle on their own. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect">Backed by cognitive science!</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Inspiration for accessible explanations: See <a href="#toc_10">my above list</a> of fave math resources. Also, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a> and <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/educational-youtube-channels/">Educational YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>To <em>practice</em> making accessible explanations, I recommend starting a blog or YouTube channel, then sharing with friends for feedback. (and maybe share on Reddit if you want to &quot;grow your audience&quot; or however one gets discovered on the internet these days)</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Writing stories</h3>

<p>Why did our ancestors tell stories, when there were other matters of survival? If stories are stress-relief, why do bad things happen in all fables? If stories are advice, why use fiction at all?</p>

<p>My hypothesis: stories <em>do</em> help us survive, beyond &quot;mere&quot; stress-relief. They <em>do</em> advise us on choices, consequences, and character growth. But why use fiction? For the same reason Newton imagined a cannonball orbiting the Earth, or Einstein imagined travelling beside a light beam: exaggerated fictions are how we explore deep facts. To paraphrase Picasso: <em>“Art is a lie that tells the truth.”</em></p>

<p>So: <strong>what truth, that you learned the hard way, do you want to share the story way?</strong></p>

<p>(What <em>is</em> a &quot;story&quot;? In short:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone needs/wants something, <em>but</em></li>
<li>There&#39;s an inner/outer obstacle, <em>therefore</em></li>
<li>They act/learn/change,</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#39;t <em>tell</em> your truth with an abstract sermon, but <em>show</em> it with the worked-example of a compressed life.)</p>

<p>Once you know your story&#39;s purpose, <em>then</em> you can apply technical craft. I recommend:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LessonsfromtheScreenplay/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid">Lessons From The Screenplay</a> (YouTube channel)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060391683">Story</a> by Rob McKee (book)</li>
</ul>

<p>For practice &amp; inspiration, here&#39;s <a href="https://storyaday.org/writing-prompt-sites/">places to get writing prompts</a>. (I&#39;ve personally used r/WritingPrompts a lot) Write short stories, and share them with friends for feedback!</p>

<p>Finally, I <em>anti-</em>recommend doing a Three-Act Structure or Hero&#39;s Journey or whatever. Don&#39;t make an &quot;archetypical narrative&quot;. Make an atypical narrative, that&#39;s uniquely you.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">Coding</h3>

<p><strong>If you can read &amp; write, then you can code.</strong> If you can understand &quot;if-then&quot; sentences, the word &quot;and&quot;, <em>and</em> this sentence referring to itself... then you understand conditionals, logic, and recursion, the foundations of programming.</p>

<p>Sadly, coding (and STEM) has this aura of &quot;beware, mad geniuses only&quot;. So, let&#39;s break that aura with 1) small weekend projects, that are 2) actually useful and/or fun, and 3) you can create <em>entirely online</em>, for free, without downloading anything!</p>

<p><strong>HTML: making sites.</strong> Go to <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities.org</a>, sign up for a free account, and do their interactive tutorial on HTML. By the end, you&#39;ll have your <em>very own public website you can share.</em> A manifesto? A personal page for your cat? Links to your favorite slashfics? The sky&#39;s the limit!</p>

<p><strong>CSS: making sites look pretty.</strong> Download the Stylus add-on (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne">Chrome</a>). <em>[Note: Stylus with an &quot;us&quot;, NOT Stylish. Stylish is malware!]</em> Go to a website that distracts you, click the add-on, then &quot;Write New Style&quot;. Paste the CSS code: <code>body{ filter: grayscale(100%); }</code>. <em>This turns the site black &amp; white,</em> so it&#39;s less attention-grabbing! With CSS and Stylus, you can modify how websites look, to fit <em>your</em> needs – hide YouTube comments, hide the &quot;approve cookies&quot; popup, or make everything Comic Sans.</p>

<p>To learn CSS: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy&#39;s HTML/CSS course</a> is free, with interactive tutorials!</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript: making sites do things.</strong> <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Khan Academy&#39;s Intro to JavaScript</a> is chockful of interactive tutorials where you draw &amp; animate things with code. It&#39;s fun! And the foundations it teaches you apply to <em>all</em> modern programming languages, not just JavaScript.</p>

<p>Finally, the most important note – if you&#39;re ever unsure how to do something, do what the pros do: look it up online, copy-paste sample code, and stitch it together until your monster comes alive.</p>

<p>(Tools: for a code editor, I use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. For web hosting, I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. For domain names, I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Making games</h3>

<p>KEEP. YOUR SCOPE. SMALL.</p>

<p>KEEP YOUR SCOPE SMALL.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t make your projects too big&quot; is true for learning any art form, but aspiring gamedevs have it the worst, coz they&#39;re inspired by AAA games that took 100s of people years to make, so let me say it again:</p>

<p>KEEP. YOUR. SCOPE. S. M. A. L. L.</p>

<p>Okay, now, my fave resources on Game Design:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid">Game Maker&#39;s Tool Kit</a> (YouTube channel) (start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMggqenxuZc">Valve&#39;s Invisible Tutorial</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321886927">A Game Design Vocabulary</a> (book) (<a href="https://w.itch.io/level-design-lessons">free sample</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780123694966">The Art of Game Design</a> (textbook)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="toc_16">Going indie</h3>

<p>First, I must admit that being a financially sustainable indie is 50% luck. (For the 50% skill, see my above advice on learning.)</p>

<p>But as poker players know, managing your luck <em>is</em> a skill. So, I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://sive.rs/tarzan">Change careers like Tarzan</a>.</strong> Do <em>not</em> quit your old job until the new one can support you. For example: set up a Patreon for your side-hustle and set it to charging &quot;per thing&quot;, until you&#39;re ready to do it full-time and switch to &quot;per month&quot;. (Or: save enough money that you can afford no income for a while)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make lots of small bets.</strong> Make lots of small projects – <em>each one &quot;betting&quot; in a different direction</em> – and when one of them gets more successful than usual, invest slightly more in that direction. For example, <a href="https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/">my first Explorable Explanation</a> was a gamedev tutorial I made in 3 days, which hit #1 on Hacker News, so now I&#39;ve been on this direction for 6 years. (Honestly, it&#39;s time for a change)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_17">Good mental health</h3>

<p>Ha ha if you figure out how to reliably maintain good mental health let <em>me</em> know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still struggling, but &quot;my collected lessons so far&quot; are in my interactive story, <a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety/">Adventures With Anxiety</a>, and its companion essay, <a href="https://ncase.me/mental-health/">Mental Health Tips &amp; Resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In sum:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Humans are social learning animals. So, we have social needs, growth needs, and animal needs. Think: <em>&quot;A long, healthy life tackling important challenges with and for the people I love.&quot;</em> There is no meaning <em>of</em> life, but these needs give the meaning <em>in</em> life.</li>
<li>Emotions are (imperfect, wordless) signals on which needs are being met &amp; unmet. So, don&#39;t &quot;stoically&quot; ignore your emotions, nor &quot;always trust your gut&quot;. Trust, but verify.</li>
<li>Meet your needs reliably with good habits (i.e. &quot;virtues&quot;), which are created via small steps, small rewards, and repetition.</li>
</ul>

<p>So uh, yeah, good luck</p>
