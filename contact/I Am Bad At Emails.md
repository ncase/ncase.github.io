# I Am Bad At Emails

I am become Sisyphus, and the inbox is my boulder.

I can't give each email a thoughtful response, but I'd feel dirty giving a *thoughtless* response. So, I wrote this FAQ to give you thoughtful answers *now*, rather than have you wait 4+ weeks for a useless reply. Check it out!

### I've sent you a fan letter!

Awww 💖 Thank you!  I sincerely mean that.  I most likely won't be able to reply (I Am Bad At Emails) but I promise you I read each fan letter, and put them in a folder labelled "awww", so I can re-read them whenever I'm feeling down:

![I Am Bad At Emails]()

### May I reuse/remix your work?

Sure! All my work is public domain under the [Creative Commons Zero waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). That means you can reuse/remix it for the classroom, your blog, a YouTube video, any purpose at all.  Attribution is kind to both me & your audience, but not legally mandatory.

Why do I do this? Partly my belief that copyright law has ditched "foster creativity" as a goal and is now just crony rent-seeking. Partly because I want educators & bloggers to reuse my work without fear of legal goons. And partly because life is too short to send legal goons.

You can get the code/art to all my projects [on Github](https://github.com/ncase)!

### May I translate your work?

Thank you, and yes! Note that most of my projects already have fan-translations – if you go to the project page, you'll find a list of translations in a sidebar or at the bottom. If your language isn't there, the list will also link to instructions on how to translate it!

(Because I Am Bad At Emails, it'll take me a few weeks to link to your translation online. Sorry!)

### I noticed your work on platform X – was that allowed?

Legally yes, since all my stuff is public domain (see [above answer]).

However, if the uploader is *pretending to be me,* that's probably against the platform's impersonation rules! So, to be clear:

**I HAVE NEVER PUBLISHED ANYTHING ON THE APP STORE, OR ON STEAM.**

Full list of where I *do* publish stuff: [my website](https://ncase.me/), [itch.io](https://ncase.itch.io/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/ncase), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_zZ8QA-J3r-UiATQImmWg), [Newgrounds](https://nutcasenightmare.newgrounds.com/). (But my ancient Flash games are all over the place: Kongregate, ArmorGames, and others I'm forgetting)

If my stuff is somewhere I didn't post it, but 1) it's labelled "[Fan Port]" or "[Unofficial]", or 2) credits me in a way that's clear they're *not* me, and 3) has a link to the free original, then: that's A-OK!  If not, kindly (KINDLY) let the poster know to do that.  Thanks!

### May I commission you / interview you / invite you to do a talk?

I'm currently on hiatus, so sadly no!  I'm very flattered though.  But if you'd like another maker of Explorable Explanations to work with, check out the other creators at [Explorabl.es](https://explorabl.es/)!

### I have a suggestion / fix / idea for a project!

If it's a small glitch or typo, thank you so much for catching it! I'll fix it as soon as I can – (that is: a few weeks, coz I Am Bad At Emails) – and I could add you to the credits if you'd like!

If it's a bigger suggestion (like adding another voting method to *Build A Better Ballot* or more strategies to *Evolution of Trust*) sadly I must decline, otherwise I'd do nothing but update all my old works forever. I must leave them as they are, with all their flaws.

### Could you help me with a project?

I'm flattered, but sadly I don't have the capacity to collaborate directly, or give specific tailored feedback. But if all you need is to reuse/remix my work, you already have my permission, [see above answer!](#toc_2) As for general advice on how to write/code/design/learn, [see the answers below!](#toc_9)

### How Do I Learn...

First, some general advice:

Most people (including myself!) practice inefficiently by default. Or if they *do* practice "efficiently", it's at the cost of being boring & demotivating.

So, to learn in a way that's efficient *and* motivating, I recommend **making *small* projects.** If you just learned about Special Relativity, write a *short* essay explaining it in lay words. If you want to practice writing dialogue, write a *short* story with lots of talking.

Also, I highly recommend **Spaced Repetition**. It's "flashcards on steroids", backed by replicated cognitive science. Check out [this video](https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/). Most people use the app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), but I use a physical [Leitner Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvF1XuseZFE), coz the tactility makes it more fun, thus more motivating. Note: Spaced Repetition isn't just for memorizing raw facts, but also deeper understanding – to your cards, add "why" questions, visual proofs, practice problems, etc.

Finally, read this: **[What Works, What Doesn't](http://presentationcollege.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-works-what-doesnt.pdf)**. It's a summary by 5 cognitive scientists on what studying methods work or don't. (For example: highlighting & re-reading, the two most popular methods, don't work.)

Now, for learning *specific* things...

### Math

*The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, “math class is stupid and boring,” and they are right.*    
~ [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)

If I were the Education Czar, I would remove math from the compulsory curriculum, *because* I love math. Nothing kills the love for something like *forcing people to do it with no intrinsic motivation.*

So if you wanna learn a math topic, please first *know your motivation*. Maybe there's a real-world use (Bayes' Theorem, nonlinear dynamics), or beautiful for its own sake (geometry, complex analysis). Whatever it is, **Step 1: know your purpose.**

Then **Step 2: intuition first.** Imagine a music class where students draw notes on bars for years *and never hear an actual song*. That's math class. If you're learning math topic X, first look up "[X] visual" or "[X] intuition" on YouTube or DuckDuckGo/Google. (My fave math resources are listed below)

**Step 3: practice with feedback.** Use spaced repetition ([see above](#toc_9)) to practice recalling facts, deep conceptual questions, and even quick practice problems. Yes, this is the boring step, but if you know your purpose & have the intuition, it'll feel and *be* meaningful.

My fave math resources:

* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), especially his series on [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr). (YouTube channel)
* [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) (blog)
* [Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780813349107) (textbook)
* [The Art of Strategy](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393337174) for game theory. (P.S: I read this book 15 years ago for fun, *then* my Econ professor assigned it as a textbook. `hackerman.jpeg`)
* [The Theoretical Minimum](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses) for physics. (books & free Stanford lectures online)

I haven't personally used these resources much, but I've heard great things about them:

* [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) (STEM, fundamentals & advanced)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (the whole K-12 curriculum)

### Writing

To make your writing flow: [Therefore & But, Not "And Then"](https://vimeo.com/123759973). Novices write "this happens *and then* that happens *and then* this happens"... *but* that's boring... *therefore* you should connect things like: "this happens *but* that happens *therefore* this happens."

*(and then...)*

To make your writing concise: write your first draft, get its word count, then multiply that number by 0.9 (90%). *Cut your writing down to that new word count.* (I got this tip from [On Writing Well](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060891541). Also, [Strunk & White](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780205309023) is actually helpful?)

Finally, don't worry about writing with "style". Just write with *substance*. What you find substantial is what you find valuable. Your set of values is what makes your voice identifiable. Your voice is your style.

Therefore: substance *creates* style.
Cook something nutritious *and* delicious.

### Writing accessible explanations

In my answer on [how to learn math](#toc_10), I listed the steps: **1) Purpose, 2) Intuition, *then* 3) Practice.** How to *teach* math, or any topic, is just giving your learner those three things in that order.

Specific tips:

- **Purpose:** [First give them the headache, then give them the aspirin.](https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/if-math-is-the-aspirin-then-how-do-you-create-the-headache/) And if possible, show cool visuals & real-world uses.
- **Intuition:** [EXAMPLES FIRST](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/my-favourite-pedagogical-principle-examples-first/). Use the [ADEPT Method](https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/). Show pictures. When possible, give intuitive proofs for facts, not just "hey memorize this crap".
- **Problems:** Cognitive apprenticeship – first do a "worked example" where you show your process, *then* give the learner a similar problem to tackle on their own. [Backed by cognitive science!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect)

Inspiration for accessible explanations: See [my above list](#toc_10) of fave math resources. Also, [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/) and [Educational YouTube](https://collegeinfogeek.com/educational-youtube-channels/).

To *practice* making accessible explanations, I recommend starting a blog or YouTube channel, then sharing with friends for feedback. (and maybe share on Reddit if you want to "grow your audience" or however one gets discovered on the internet these days)

### Writing stories

Why did our ancestors tell stories, when there were other matters of survival? If stories are stress-relief, why do bad things happen in all fables? If stories are advice, why use fiction at all?

My hypothesis: stories *do* help us survive, beyond "mere" stress-relief. They *do* advise us on choices, consequences, and character growth. But why use fiction? For the same reason Newton imagined a cannonball orbiting the Earth, or Einstein imagined travelling beside a light beam: exaggerated fictions are how we explore deep facts. To paraphrase Picasso: *“Art is a lie that tells the truth.”*

So: **what truth, that you learned the hard way, do you want to share the story way?**

(What *is* a "story"? In short:

1. Someone needs/wants something, *but*
2. There's an inner/outer obstacle, *therefore*
3. They act/learn/change,
4. Repeat.

Don't *tell* your truth with an abstract sermon, but *show* it with the worked-example of a compressed life.)

Once you know your story's purpose, *then* you can apply technical craft. I recommend:

- [Kurt Vonnegut's 8 Tips](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/04/03/kurt-vonnegut-on-writing-stories/) (mini-essay)
- [Lessons From The Screenplay](https://www.youtube.com/c/LessonsfromtheScreenplay/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (YouTube channel)
- [Story](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060391683) by Rob McKee (book)

For practice & inspiration, here's [places to get writing prompts](https://storyaday.org/writing-prompt-sites/). (I've personally used r/WritingPrompts a lot) Write short stories, and share them with friends for feedback!

Finally, I *anti-*recommend doing a Three-Act Structure or Hero's Journey or whatever. Don't make an "archetypical narrative". Make an atypical narrative, that's uniquely you.

### Coding

**If you can read & write, then you can code.** If you can understand "if-then" sentences, the word "and", *and* this sentence referring to itself... then you understand conditionals, logic, and recursion, the foundations of programming.

Sadly, coding (and STEM) has this aura of "beware, mad geniuses only". So, let's break that aura with 1) small weekend projects, that are 2) actually useful and/or fun, and 3) you can create *entirely online*, for free, without downloading anything!

**HTML: making sites.** Go to [Neocities.org](https://neocities.org/), sign up for a free account, and do their interactive tutorial on HTML. By the end, you'll have your *very own public website you can share.* A manifesto? A personal page for your cat? Links to your favorite slashfics? The sky's the limit!

**CSS: making sites look pretty.** Download the Stylus add-on ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)). *[Note: Stylus with an "us", NOT Stylish. Stylish is malware!]* Go to a website that distracts you, click the add-on, then "Write New Style". Paste the CSS code: `body{ filter: grayscale(100%); }`. *This turns the site black & white,* so it's less attention-grabbing! With CSS and Stylus, you can modify how websites look, to fit *your* needs – hide YouTube comments, hide the "approve cookies" popup, or make everything Comic Sans.

To learn CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) is free, with interactive tutorials!

**JavaScript: making sites do things.** [Khan Academy's Intro to JavaScript](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) is chockful of interactive tutorials where you draw & animate things with code. It's fun! And the foundations it teaches you apply to *all* modern programming languages, not just JavaScript.

Finally, the most important note – if you're ever unsure how to do something, do what the pros do: look it up online, copy-paste sample code, and stitch it together until your monster comes alive.

### Making games

KEEP. YOUR SCOPE. SMALL.

KEEP YOUR SCOPE SMALL.

"Don't make your projects too big" is true for learning any art form, but aspiring gamedevs have it the worst, coz they're inspired by AAA games that took 100s of people years to make, so let me say it again:

KEEP. YOUR. SCOPE. S. M. A. L. L.

Okay, now, my fave resources on Game Design:

- [Game Maker's Tool Kit](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (YouTube channel) (start with [Valve's Invisible Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMggqenxuZc))
- [A Game Design Vocabulary](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321886927) (book) ([free sample](https://w.itch.io/level-design-lessons))
- [The Art of Game Design](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780123694966) (textbook)

To start making games *without* knowing how to code – or even buying or downloading anything yet! – check out these tools:

- [Twine](https://twinery.org/2/#!/welcome), for Choose Your Own Adventure-likes
- [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org/), for top-down exploration games (think Undertale)
- [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/), for Sokoban-like puzzle games


For practice making SMALL-SCOPED games, check out itch·io's [list of game jams](https://itch.io/jams)!

### Going indie

First, I must admit that being a financially sustainable indie is 50% luck. (For the 50% skill, see my above advice on learning.)

But as poker players know, managing your luck *is* a skill. So, I recommend:

- **[Change careers like Tarzan](https://sive.rs/tarzan).** Do *not* quit your old job until the new one can support you. For example: set up a Patreon for your side-hustle and set it to charging "per thing", until you're ready to do it full-time and switch to "per month". (Or: save enough money that you can afford no income for a while)

- **Make lots of small bets.** Make lots of small projects – *each one "betting" in a different direction* – and when one of them gets more successful than usual, invest slightly more in that direction. For example, [my first Explorable Explanation](https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/) was a gamedev tutorial I made in 3 days, which hit #1 on Hacker News, so now I've been on this direction for 6 years. (Honestly, it's time for a change)

### Good mental health

Ha ha if you figure out how to reliably maintain good mental health let *me* know.

I'm still struggling, but "my collected lessons so far" are in my interactive story, [Adventures With Anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/), and its companion essay, [Mental Health Tips & Resources](https://ncase.me/mental-health/).

**In sum:**

* Humans are social learning animals. So, we have social needs, growth needs, and animal needs. Think: *"A long, healthy life tackling important challenges with and for the people I love."* There is no meaning *of* life, but these needs give the meaning *in* life.
* Emotions are (imperfect, wordless) signals on which needs are being met & unmet. So, don't "stoically" ignore your emotions, nor "always trust your gut". Trust, but verify.
* Meet your needs reliably with good habits (i.e. "virtues"), which are created via small steps, small rewards, and repetition.

So uh, yeah, good luck
